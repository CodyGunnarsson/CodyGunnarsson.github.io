            Born and raised in Calgary, Alberta I grew up with a love of camping in the Rocky Mountains 
            and exploring everything around me. From a young age, I was always exploring and asking about 
            anything I could see, hear or touch. This curiosity shaped my young adult life, working in different 
            roles where I learned how to problem solve and think critically.

            I began working in my teenage years doing light maintenance and cleaning on residential and commercial 
            properties until I moved to working at a large retail chain in inventory management throughout high school. 
            This laid a foundation for me to develop myself in both an administrative and hands-on capacity as I 
            advanced in my career.

            After completing high school, I started working in a custom metal fabrication shop, learning every tool 
            and process involved in designing, fabricating and installing custom metal works - primarily architectural 
            pieces and kitchen equipment. During these years, I attended the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology 
            for Sheet Metal.

            After a few years in metal work, I decided to learn a new trade and had an opportunity to work with 
            fire alarm systems where I completed the Fire Alarm Technology Program from The Canadian Fire Alarm 
            Institution and gained field experience troubleshooting, verifying and inspecting fire alarm systems.

            Eventually, I returned to custom metal work but in a more senior capacity, focusing on organizing job 
            sites, training apprentices and coordinating with clients directly. This laid the groundwork for my 
            interest in more formal project management.

            In 2019, I began working for a modular manufacturing and construction company in project management 
            in the major projects department. I worked on various types of projects with diverse client needs. 
            During this time, I obtained my Project Management Professional certificate from the Project Management 
            Institute and championed a Lean Six Sigma program the company was running in-house.
